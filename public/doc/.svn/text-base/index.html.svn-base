<h1>AIT class time table project</h1>
<p>This project is to create a web site showing courses offering in a semester. Student can search for interesting courses and then register. The web site will show a nice weekly class schedule of all courses the student currently registers. If a student tries to add a course that conflict with the added courses, the system would show warning and does not allow the student to add that newly added course.</p>

<p>During the semester, some instructor might want to have a make-up class. He can use a service from this web site to find an appropriate time slot for the make-up class. The system will combine all classes of all students taking the course and show to the instructor. The instructor can also create a survey asking student to vote. Students can vote and also give comments. Moreover,this feature can also be used for scheduling exams as well.</p>

<h2>Question 1a</h2>

<p># What subject will people be able to learn in the community that you're building?<br/>
- AIT people will learn about other students class timetable and have discussion board about make-up class, exam schedule, etc.<br/></p>

<p># What do you want people to say about your service after a visit?<br/>
- This is a very friendly user interface for browsing classes, registering classes, displaying his/her weekly class timetable. This is a nice tool for scheduling make-up classes and exams.<br/></p>

<p># What are the relevant distinct user classes?<br/>
- Please see the user classes above.<br/></p>

<p># What should a user on a mobile phone be able to do? Is it productive to mix voice and text interaction? (See "Multimodal Requirements for Voice Markup Languages" from the Web Consortium at http://www.w3.org/TR/multimodal-reqs for some hints as to what will be possible.) <br/>
- A user can use most of the features on a mobile phone. It is possible to mix voice and text interaction into the system such as using voice to vote on make-up class or exam schedule. Therefore, voting by voice is a great feature to have.<br/></p>

<h2>Question 1c</h2>
<p>Please see the usage scenario in question 1b

<h2>Question 2</h2>
<p>
<h4>Offline alternatives</h4>
<dd>The offline alternatives to timetable.ait.ac.th are the system which will give the new opportunities to make the study life at AIT more easier. By let students can make their timetable from registering courses. After registering, the thing to do is just let the system handle the tedious task. The system will let the student know if the conflict from overlapping course happens. For the instructor who has many times annoyed from scheduling some thing for the student. Now, the system will let you know when is the suitable time for making a schedule e.g. make up class, extra class or even exam timetable. There will be many times that the problem might happens from such a large number of students such as students' time is conflict so there isn't any free slot for making a schedule. Then the system will let the instructor know that what time is the conflict from student's time is the least. Neither of these types of function are very accessible to outsiders. But the benefits of these functions can be imported into the online world. By providing a forum for all members i.e. student and instructor, this way will give the community democracy. By associate with the registry will give more powerful to the system, then the system will do automatically without student registering to the system. Sometimes student may add or drop the course in the last minute, the system will let the instructor know what change in his/her course.</dd>
<h4>Online features.</h4>
<dd>It would be better if student and instructor could have a specific place to share some knowledge and idea together. This is not just for making up a class or any making an appointment. So the forum will has the place where the instructor and student could stick together. And that will make us a community.</dd>
</p>

<h2>Question 3</h2>
<p>
<dd>
Nowadays, there are many software which can create timetable very efficiency. Many universities and high school  also use software from third party company like this. The best one that we found out so easily is mimosasoftware which be used in thousand schools and universities of varying sizes(15-30,000 students). The software can do perfectly as timetable software should do. But still we think software from the third party company must have something not cover for what our need and something that we not need. Also, the important topic that we focus right now, as far as we can tell, there is still not any website would do the same thing as us. They could do many things but they didn't give any respect for the student, such as student rights to choose what time they want to do or do not. So this is why our system could give advantage than another one. Our system will do for making a better community.

<h2>Question 4</h2>
<p>
<dd>The content for our website will be provided by registered users and always kept confidential 
from any individual who does not belong to his/her contact except the instructor of that course. 
The content in our website is about course information that the users have already registered in 
that semester. After they enter the website by password, they can see any their information they 
would like, also they can see their friends' course information which is the good part for anyone
 who need to do assignment group. Finally, instructor can see any information of their students 
who take his/her course.</dd>

<h2>Question 5</h2>
<p>
<dd>Our temporary hostname will be 'http://sis.timetable.ait.ac.th/', and after discussion with registry coordinator we will come up with the decisive name later.</dd>
